Once the Power BI Desktop is connect to the SQL Server DB, all the fields are now available for 
creating the dashboard

# Creating Measures for Latest Values

Before starting the dashboard, lets create some measures using DAX to calculate the current
values of CPU usage, memory usage and disk usage.

- In the cpu usage measure we will calculate the value of cpu usage against the latest date and
time value. We will use the calculate function to extract this value. Use the sum of CPU usage
as the expression. And the latest date and time value as filter. = The latest cpu usage should
now be available.

- In the dsik usage measure we will calculate the value of disk usage against the latest data 
and time value

-Lets calculate the value of the latest memory usage against the latest date and time value. 

# Creating Live Dashboard 

Now that we are directly connected to the sql server db, lets create a dashboard to display the
system performance information in real time. 

- Lets create a title for the dashboard using the text box visual. 

- Lets Add a gauge visual to display the CPU usage
- Add the latest cpu usage measure to the values field
- Add cpu usage field to the minimum value area as minimum 
- Add the maximum value area as maximum
- Lets change the title of the gauge visual to the cpu usage
- Create copies of this and do similar for Disk usage and Memory Usage

- Lets add a line chart to display the bytes sent and received per second 
- Add bytes received field to the Y axis
- Add the bytes sent field to the secondary Y axis
- Add the time field to the X axis

- Lets add a line chart to display the cpu interrupts and cpu calls per second 
- Add cpu calls field to the Y axis
- Add the cpu interrupts field to the secondary Y axis
- Add the time field to the X axis

- Lets add a donut chart to display the memory used and memory free information
- Add memory free and memory used to the values area


Our dashboard is complete, but we will limeit the line charts to display maximum 30 latest items
